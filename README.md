# Textfrog
textfrog the lang



Textfrog is a lovely? succinct? powerful? addictive? (domain?) (script?) (interpreted?) (battery included?) (implicitly typed) computer language.

* It can be used in (text processing?)
* Replace shell scripting? (like bash awk)
* My main language? (take some(most) place belonged to C, Java, Bash, Lua, Python)
* It use the ability of Java world and C world.

It is in it's young age, but already seems 

* good to use 
* do right things in the right way 
* in good improving iteratering

It may be released public when mature enough, for being thankful to God to lead me to it.

## general idea about language

* there is no pattern, no rules, everything is possible. (glance at lanuage making tools)
* you shall write every line of code happily, not painly. (glance at rust lang)
* If you not like the grammar, however powerful a lanuage is, you will not use it.
* a human language is useless if you have no other people to speak with, but it's okay even you are the only one use it for computer language, because it talks to computer.
