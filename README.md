Textfrog the lang

## about C
	C can be everything. Actually every reasonable/base software is written in C.
 
	Long live C. Not mean C is perfect. I actually to see some cons about C.
 
	like macro is a bitch. and #define can define constants and macro, or just alias.
 
	semantic confusing. I still fail to write a C compiler or even a proprocessor parser,
	after I gazed at source code of TCC for days.
 
## about Rust
	Time and time, I read some article saying leaving Rust after years of patience.
 
	Make me laugh, I used 3 days to figure out not to waste time on Rust years ago.
 
## about big open source projects, like: linux, firefox, godot, llvm, ...
	Big things are mostly evil. They are great actually, much better than the closed source ones.
 
	Problem is they care more about 'success' of self than doing good things.
 
	If they were library, seperated into modules. Others can use any part of it. 
 
	Then people re-engineer their own OS, browser, game eninge, and compiler. Currently is so difficult.
 
	You get nothing or use it as a whole.
 
## about AI
	If not a scam, it's just a toy.
 
	I played with chatgpt for 10 minutes, It talks bullshit.
 
	I played with Grok(x.ai), happily asked for some hints for how to design more wonderful game world.
 
	When I want to use it locally, after downloaded 100GB data, I did some further search,
 
	It need about 400GB model download, If it's Okay. But also need a lot of highend GPU to run.
 
	Not reasonable for personal use. I deleted the downloads.
 
## about racism in programming world
	I used to see someone call me like 'a wield asian man wearing a 3D glass' after seen my avatar.
 
	Like myself seeing project made by Indian, preconcept it as a student project.
 
	Successful projects always hosted by western people, or at least in a reasonable western name.
 
	names like JiaTan leads to spammers.
 
## about how textfrog(tfg) is used by me
	tfg was invented more than 1 or 2 years.
 
	I replaced alot bash/sh script used daily with tfg.
 
	Also for applications. web backends. Also used in products which are me one person projects.
 
	It helped me to save tons of time. quicker to implement thing. 
 
	Even I'm now troubled with finding things to work on with.
 
	I should release the source. but I predict that few people see it and intrested about it. 
 
	So It's better not yet release than released without attentions.

 	Althoug it's a gift from God, I should not keep by my own.

# Description 

![icon](textfrog.webp)

Textfrog is a lovely? succinct? powerful? addictive? (domain?) (script?) (interpreted?) (battery included?) (implicitly typed) computer language.

* It can be used in (text processing?)
* Replace shell scripting? (like bash awk)
* My main language? (take some(most) place belonged to C, Java, Bash, Lua, Python)
* It use the ability of Java world and C world.

It is in it's young age, but already seems 

* good to use 
* do right things in the right way 
* in good improving iteratering

It may be released public when mature enough, for being thankful to God to lead me to it.

## General idea about languages

* there is no pattern, no rules, everything is possible. (glance at language making tools)
* you shall write every line of code happily, not painly. (glance at rust lang)
* If you not like the grammar, however powerful a lanuage is, you will not use it. (so go straight to samples when you see a new language, see [textfrog's grammar in 5 minutes](SimpleDescGrammar.md) )
* a human language is useless if you have no other people to speak with, but it's okay even you are the only one use a computer language, because it talks to computer.
