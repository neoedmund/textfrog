Textfrog the lang

![icon](textfrog.webp)

Textfrog is a lovely? succinct? powerful? addictive? (domain?) (script?) (interpreted?) (battery included?) (implicitly typed) computer language.

* It can be used in (text processing?)
* Replace shell scripting? (like bash awk)
* My main language? (take some(most) place belonged to C, Java, Bash, Lua, Python)
* It use the ability of Java world and C world.

It is in it's young age, but already seems 

* good to use 
* do right things in the right way 
* in good improving iteratering

It may be released public when mature enough, for being thankful to God to lead me to it.

## General idea about languages

* there is no pattern, no rules, everything is possible. (glance at language making tools)
* you shall write every line of code happily, not painly. (glance at rust lang)
* If you not like the grammar, however powerful a lanuage is, you will not use it. (so go straight to samples when you see a new language, see [textfrog's grammar in 5 minutes](SimpleDescGrammar.md) )
* a human language is useless if you have no other people to speak with, but it's okay even you are the only one use a computer language, because it talks to computer.
